## Word-Scanner
The following python program is used to scan and process an input text stream assuming that the words in the input stream are separated by whitespaces.

After reading each word, filter the word as follows: If the first letter of the word is preceded or its last letter is followed by non-alphabetical characters (punctuation marks and/or numerical digits), erase them from the word; however, if the word contains non-alphabetical characters in the middle, ignore the alphabetical characters beyond them, and if the parts of a word separated by dashes, then consider each part as a separate word. For example, the word “…William?Mary…” should be filtered as the word “William”, and the word “fish−net” should be filtered as the word “fish” and the word “net”. You also need to convert each uppercase letter to a lowercase for the final list.
